Certainly! I can demonstrate various text formatting options, including subscripts, superscripts, bold text, tables, and more. Let's create a simple example with a mathematical expression and a table:

1. Mathematical Expression:
   - Power of x: \(x^2\)
   - Subscript of x: \(x_1\)
   - Combination: \(y = x_1^{x^2}\)

2. Table:
   Let's create a table with two columns: "Item" and "Quantity."

   ```
   +--------------+----------+
   |   Item       | Quantity |
   +--------------+----------+
   | Apples       |   10     |
   | Oranges      |   5      |
   | Bananas      |   8      |
   +--------------+----------+
   ```

Now, let me format the above information accordingly:

Mathematical Expression:
- Power of x: \(x^2\)
- Subscript of x: \(x_1\)
- Combination: \(y = x_1^{x^2}\)

Table:

```
+--------------+----------+
|   Item       | Quantity |
+--------------+----------+
| Apples       |   10     |
| Oranges      |   5      |
| Bananas      |   8      |
+--------------+----------+
```

Feel free to ask if you have any specific text formatting requests or if you'd like to see more examples!
