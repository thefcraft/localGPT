The function uses a dictionary called `ops` to maintain the precedence of operators. We then convert the infix expression to postfix notation (also known as Reverse Polish Notation) using two stacks: one for operands, and another for operators. The function performs the operations in the order specified by the postfix notation, and returns the final result. You can test it with various expressions like `23+45*` or `10-2*3+`."
